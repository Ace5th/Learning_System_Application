Imperfect:
1. For admin dashboard (its controller), the logic for assignment status can be added into the assignmentSchema or a middleware
2. Some of the route for the admin is not ordered or written well
3. Detail of lecturer's students can be more flushed out (lecturer's route)
4. Many of the route is not orderly, write it properly
5. Kirim peringatan email
6. Bisa nyalakan helmet kalau mau, asal perhatikan confignya
7. Akan ada error jika mengaktivasi joi sebelum upload.array, jadi perlu diurus
8. Some html code is near code-breaking (located in lecturer route, views, nested logic)
10. Warning feature for every user
12. Document kalau bisa word
13. Field untuk search untuk semua yang ada listnya
14. Pemberian detail mengenai tiap field information untuk route
15. Dashboard bling
16. Add notice via email if informations are changed and add undo something if the user didn't initiate the process directly
17. Add photo profile for user
18. Need to have the next step after student finished all the proceedings, are they to be deleted or what (Currently, after signing, the student db is immediately deleted from lecturer)
19. Use on for git push on master
